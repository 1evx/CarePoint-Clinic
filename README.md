# CarePoint 🏥 – Clinic Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

**CarePoint** is a simple yet robust **Clinic Management System** developed as a group project for **Diploma in Information Technology, Year 2 Semester 5**. Built using **Python**, this system utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to simulate real-world clinic operations across multiple user roles — **Admin, Doctor, and Patient** — and is designed to manage registrations, appointments, medical records, and payments in a streamlined way.

## 🧑‍⚕️ System Roles and Features

### 👨‍💼 Admin Features
- Manage Patient Accounts (add, update, delete)
- Manage Doctor Accounts
- Handle Walk-In Appointments
- Track Patient Medical Records
- Manage Medicine Inventory
- Process and Track Payments

### 🩺 Doctor Features
- View Daily Appointments
- Access and Update Patient Medical Records
- Prescribe Medicines
- Log Out Functionality

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Patient Features
- Sign Up / Log In Authentication
- View Available Timeslots
- Book Appointments
- Cancel Upcoming Appointments
- View Medical History and Past Visits

## 💡 Object-Oriented Concepts Used

- **Class & Object**: Defined models for users, appointments, medicine, and records.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensured data hiding and controlled access.
- **Inheritance**: Shared functionality across different roles.
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding for custom role-based behavior.

## 🐍 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **GUI**: Java-based GUI interface (Swing or JavaFX)
- **Data Storage**: Text files for persisting user and system data
- **Security**: Password hashing and "Forgot Password" features included

## 📊 Additional Functionalities

- **Payment Receipt Generation**
- **Sales Report Generation**
- **Search Functionality in Tables**
- **Forgot Password Recovery System**
- **User Feedback & System Logging**

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
